## Core Infrastructure & Compute
- **EC2** - Virtual servers for hosting your applications
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** - Distribute traffic across multiple instances
- **Auto Scaling Groups** - Automatically scale your infrastructure based on demand

## Database & Storage
- **RDS** - Managed databases (MySQL/PostgreSQL for Laravel)
- **S3** - Object storage for static assets, file uploads, backups
- **ElastiCache** - Redis/Memcached for caching (great for Laravel)

## Deployment & CI/CD
- **CodePipeline & CodeBuild** - AWS-native CI/CD solutions
- **CodeDeploy** - Automated application deployments
- **Elastic Container Service (ECS)** or **EKS** - Container orchestration
- **Lambda** - Serverless functions for background tasks

## Essential DevOps Services
- **CloudFormation** or **CDK** - Infrastructure as Code
- **CloudWatch** - Monitoring, logging, and alerting
- **Route 53** - DNS management
- **Certificate Manager** - SSL/TLS certificates
- **VPC** - Virtual networking and security

## Recommended Learning Path
1. Start with **EC2, RDS, and S3** - deploy a simple Laravel app
2. Add **ALB and Auto Scaling** for high availability
3. Learn **CloudFormation** to manage infrastructure as code
4. Implement **CodePipeline** for automated deployments
5. Set up **CloudWatch** for monitoring
